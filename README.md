# Agentic DevOps Playground

AgenticDevOps is a next-generation, modular DevOps automation framework for Azure. It empowers teams to deliver secure, high-quality software faster by combining Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) with intelligent, autonomous AI agents for code quality, security, and cost optimization. The result: modern, scalable, and compliant DevOps workflows that accelerate innovation and reduce manual toil.

## üì¶ Latest Release Notes ([v0.0.1](https://github.com/ajeetchouksey/ajch_agenticdevops/releases/tag/v0.0.1))

### üöÄ AI PR Review Agent Highlights

- **Automated AI-Powered PR Review**: Fetches pull request diffs from GitHub, sends them to an AI model (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI), and posts structured, actionable review comments directly on the PR.
- **Critical & General Recommendations**: Clearly separates and highlights critical (must-fix, security, compliance, correctness) and general (style, maintainability, documentation, test coverage) suggestions, including both code and non-code/process feedback.
- **Highly Visible, Customizable Output**: Uses markdown formatting, headings, and emojis for maximum visibility in PR comments. Output format and prompt are fully customizable.
- **Exception List for Approval Logic**: Maintains an external `pr_review_exception_list.txt` file to define which issues should not block PR approval. Exception list is loaded at runtime for easy updates.
- **Robust Error Handling & Validation**: Validates all required environment variables and handles network/API errors gracefully with clear user-facing messages.
- **Security Best Practices**: Never prints or logs sensitive credentials, enforces input validation, and documents all security features.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Designed to run in GitHub Actions or other CI/CD environments. Example workflow provided for automated PR review on every pull request.
- **Documentation & Comparison**: Detailed documentation on setup, usage, and security, plus a comparison with GitHub Copilot PR Review.
- **Extensible & Maintainable**: Modular code structure for easy extension and maintenance. Unit and integration test coverage recommended for all new features.

#### üìù Git Hooks and Commit/PR Standards
- **Commit Message Validation**: Git hook provided to enforce commit message standards (e.g., Conventional Commits).
- **Branch and PR Naming Enforcement**: GitHub Actions/local hooks ensure branch names, PR titles, and commit messages follow repository conventions.
- **Developer Experience**: Immediate feedback to contributors, reducing review friction and improving repository hygiene.

> **Upgrade Notes:**
> - To customize which issues are ignored for PR approval, edit `pr_review_exception_list.txt`.
> - Review and update environment variables and secrets in your CI/CD pipeline.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Modular Terraform Core**: Reusable, CIS-compliant modules for Azure resources (VNET, NSG, Subnet, VMSS, Resource Groups, etc.) under `core-modules/`.
- **Landing Zones**: Predefined landing zones for application, management, connectivity, and AVD, supporting rapid, secure environment provisioning.
- **AI Agents for DevOps** (`ai-agents/`):
  - **Code Quality & Security Agent**: Integrates with code scanning tools and uses AI (e.g., Azure OpenAI) to review PRs, suggest improvements, and block insecure code.
  - **Cost Optimization Agent**: Analyzes Azure resource usage, identifies cost-saving opportunities, and sends actionable reports or automates remediation.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated code review, branch/PR naming enforcement, and pipeline orchestration.
- **Naming Conventions & Compliance**: Enforced naming standards and tagging for Azure resources, ensuring clarity and compliance.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new AI agents (e.g., for remediation, ChatOps, impact analysis) to automate more DevOps tasks.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

- **Terraform Modules**: Located in `core-modules/`, each module (e.g., `vnet`, `nsg`, `subnet`, `vmss`) is self-contained, parameterized, and follows best practices for security and maintainability.
- **Landing Zones**: Under `landingzones/`, these aggregate core modules for specific scenarios (application, management, connectivity, AVD).
- **AI Agents**: Python-based agents in `ai-agents/` folder, each with its own setup, requirements, and documentation.
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/` contains automation for code review, naming checks, and more.
