# AI PR Review vs GitHub Copilot PR Review

This document explains the differences between the custom AI PR Review agent in this repository and GitHub Copilot's PR review features.

---

### AI PR Review Agent (Custom)
- **Location:** `ai-agents/codequality_agent/ai_code_review.py`
- **How it works:**
  - Fetches pull request diffs from GitHub.
  - Sends the diff to an AI model (e.g., Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API).
  - The AI reviews only the changes in the PR, organizes suggestions into 'Critical' and 'General' categories, and provides actionable code improvement suggestions.
  - Posts a formatted review comment directly on the PR.
- **Customization:**
  - You control the prompt, review style, and which AI model is used.
  - Can be integrated into CI/CD or run manually.
- **Use cases:**
  - Enforce custom review standards.
  - Use private or organization-specific AI models.
  - Add organization-specific review logic or formatting.

#### Limitations
- Requires setup and maintenance of scripts and API keys.
- Review quality depends on the chosen AI model and prompt engineering.
- May incur additional costs for API usage (e.g., Azure OpenAI).
- Not natively integrated into the GitHub UI; requires CI/CD or manual runs.
- May require custom error handling and security considerations for secrets.

### GitHub Copilot PR Review
- **How it works:**
  - GitHub Copilot (and Copilot for PRs) uses OpenAI models to suggest code changes and review pull requests directly in the GitHub UI.
  - Provides inline suggestions, explanations, and can summarize PRs.
  - Integrated natively with GitHub and requires a Copilot subscription.
- **Customization:**
  - Limited; you cannot change the underlying prompt or model.
  - Review style and output are determined by GitHub's implementation.
- **Use cases:**
  - Quick, out-of-the-box AI review for any PR on GitHub.
  - Useful for individual developers and teams using GitHub's web interface.

#### Limitations
- Limited customization; cannot change the underlying prompt or model.
- Only available with a Copilot subscription.
- **Only available on specific GitHub plans/versions (e.g., Copilot Business/Enterprise, not all users).**
- **PR review is triggered automatically only for the first pull request; subsequent reviews must be triggered manually.**
- Review suggestions may be generic and not tailored to organization-specific standards.
- Requires internet access and GitHub integration.
- May not support private/self-hosted AI models.
