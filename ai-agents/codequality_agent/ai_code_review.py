# AI Code Review Script for GitHub PRs
#
# SECURITY WARNING: Never print, log, or store sensitive environment variables (e.g., GITHUB_TOKEN, AI_API_KEY) in logs, output, or source code.
# Always set these securely in your CI/CD environment or local shell, and avoid echoing or exposing them in error messages or debug output.
#
# PERMISSIONS: GITHUB_TOKEN should have the minimal required permissions (e.g., repo:read, pull_request:write) to interact with PRs. AI_API_KEY should have only the permissions needed for model inference. Do not use tokens with excessive privileges.
#
# SECURITY FEATURES: This script validates credentials, never prints or logs sensitive values, and enforces input validation. All error messages avoid exposing sensitive data or explicit shell commands. See documentation for more details.
#
# SECURITY NOTE: All code improvements and additions must not bypass existing security checks or introduce new vulnerabilities. 
# Ensure secure handling of dynamic content and input validation to mitigate security threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
#
# TEST COVERAGE: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new features or changes, including integration with automated test pipelines (CI/CD) for dynamic and security testing.
#
# DOCUMENTATION: Any change to the AI agent's behavior (especially in identifying critical issues, including non-code recommendations) must be documented for clarity and team alignment.
#
# NOTE: Unit tests should be added to cover error handling and output formatting logic for robustness.

"""
This script fetches pull request diffs, sends them to an AI model for review, and posts suggestions as comments on the PR.
You need a GitHub token and an AI API key (e.g., Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, etc.).

Security Best Practices:
- Do not bypass or weaken security checks in any code changes.
- Validate and sanitize all dynamic content and user input.
- Review for vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) in all PRs.

Permissions Required:
- GITHUB_TOKEN: Should have minimal permissions (e.g., repo:read, pull_request:write) to interact with PRs. Do not use tokens with excessive privileges.
- AI_API_KEY: Should have only the permissions needed for model inference. Do not use keys with broader access than necessary.

Security Features:
- Credentials are validated and never printed or logged.
- Input validation is enforced for all environment variables and PR numbers.
- Error messages avoid exposing sensitive data, explicit shell commands, or URLs for setting tokens.
- All security features and requirements are documented here and in the project documentation.

Test Coverage:
- Add/maintain unit and integration tests for all new features and changes.
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines run automated tests, including security tests.

AI Agent Behavior Documentation:
- Document any changes to how the AI agent identifies and reports critical or general issues, especially for non-code/process recommendations.
- Keep documentation up to date for team and user clarity.

Error Handling & Credential Validation:
- The script now checks for required environment variables (GITHUB_TOKEN, AI_API_KEY) before proceeding and exits with a clear error if missing.
- Error handling is implemented for network/API failures and is documented here for maintainability and troubleshooting.
