Excessive Permissions: The permissions defined suggest minimally required permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN, but suggesting a specific level of scope (e.g., repo:read) could open up potential security risks if not accurately scoped to the needs. Ensure that the scopes are precisely defined to match only what the automation script needs without opening up a broader access than necessary. Define and document specific permission scopes explicitly required for operations.
