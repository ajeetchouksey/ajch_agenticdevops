# Code Quality & Security Agent for Azure DevOps

This guide will help you set up an AI-powered agent to enhance code quality and security in your DevOps workflows. The agent integrates with code scanning tools, reviews pull requests using AI, suggests improvements, and blocks insecure code.

---

## Features
- Integrates with static code analysis and security scanning tools (e.g., SonarCloud, CodeQL)
- Uses AI to review pull requests for code quality and security issues
- Suggests code improvements and best practices
- Blocks insecure or non-compliant code from being merged
- Sends actionable feedback to developers (via PR comments, email, or chat)

---

## Step 1: Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with pull request workflow
- Access to code scanning tools (SonarCloud, CodeQL, or similar)
- (Optional) Azure OpenAI or other AI API access for code review
- Python 3.8+ installed (or use GitHub Actions)

---

## Step 2: Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ajeetchouksey/ajch_agenticdevops.git
cd ajch_agenticdevops/ai-agents/codequality_agent
```

---

## Step 3: Set Up Python Environment
```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# Or
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 4: Configure Code Scanning Tools
- Set up SonarCloud, CodeQL, or your preferred tool in your repository.
- Add configuration files (e.g., `sonar-project.properties`, `.github/codeql.yml`).

---

## Step 5: Integrate AI Code Review
- Implement a Python script (e.g., `ai_code_review.py`) that:
  - Fetches pull request diffs
  - Uses an AI API (e.g., Azure OpenAI) to review code for quality and security
  - Posts suggestions or blocks PRs with critical issues

---

## Step 6: Automate with GitHub Actions
- Create a workflow YAML file in `.github/workflows/` to:
  - Run code scanning tools on PRs
  - Run the AI code review script
  - Post results as PR comments or block merges if issues are found

---

## Step 7: Review & Respond
- Developers review feedback in PR comments or email
- Address issues and push fixes

---

## Step 8: (Optional) Extend Functionality
- Integrate with chat platforms (Teams, Slack) for notifications
- Add custom rules or organization-specific policies
- Use AI to auto-suggest code fixes
