To enable agentic DevOps, you can create AI agents that automate, monitor, and optimize your DevOps workflows. Here are some practical AI agent types you can implement:


1. Pipeline Orchestration Agent  
   - Automates the triggering and management of CI/CD pipelines. Useful for ensuring timely builds and deployments based on code changes or schedules.

2. Failure Detection & Alerting Agent  
   - Monitors pipelines and deployments, using AI/ML to detect failures and send targeted alerts (email, Teams, Slack). Helps teams respond quickly to issues.

3. Remediation Agent  
   - Suggests or applies automated fixes for common pipeline or infrastructure issues, including rollbacks or restarts. Reduces manual intervention.

4. Code Quality & Security Agent  
   - Integrates with code scanning tools and uses AI to review pull requests, suggest improvements, and block insecure code. Enhances code quality and security.

5. Cost Optimization Agent  
   - Analyzes cloud resource usage and pipeline runs, recommending or automating cost-saving actions (e.g., shutting down unused resources). Helps control cloud spend.

6. Change Impact Analysis Agent  
   - Predicts the impact of code or infrastructure changes using historical data and dependency graphs. Warns about risky changes before deployment.

7. ChatOps Agent  
   - Integrates with chat platforms for conversational control of pipelines, deployments, and monitoring. Enables users to trigger jobs and get status updates via chat.


# AI PR Review vs GitHub Copilot PR Review

The custom AI PR Review agent provides two types of recommendations in PR comments:

- **Critical Recommendations:** Issues that must be addressed before merging, such as security vulnerabilities, logic errors, or compliance problems.
- **General Recommendations:** Suggestions for code readability, maintainability, style, or minor improvements.

These recommendations are clearly separated and highlighted in the PR review comment for maximum visibility.

See [AI_PR_REVIEW_COMPARISON.md](./AI_PR_REVIEW_COMPARISON.md) for a detailed comparison between the custom AI PR Review agent and GitHub Copilot PR Review.
