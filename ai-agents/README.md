To enable agentic DevOps, you can create AI agents that automate, monitor, and optimize your DevOps workflows. Here are some practical AI agent types you can implement:

1. Pipeline Orchestration Agent  
   - Triggers CI/CD pipelines based on schedules, code changes, or detected anomalies.
   - Can auto-rerun failed jobs and escalate issues.

2. Failure Detection & Alerting Agent  
   - Monitors pipeline runs, tests, and deployments.
   - Uses AI/ML to detect patterns in failures and sends targeted alerts (email, Teams, Slack).

3. Remediation Agent  
   - Suggests or applies automated fixes for common pipeline or infrastructure issues.
   - Can roll back deployments or restart services based on error patterns.

4. Code Quality & Security Agent  
   - Integrates with code scanning tools.
   - Uses AI to review pull requests, suggest improvements, and block insecure code.

5. Cost Optimization Agent  
   - Analyzes cloud resource usage and pipeline runs.
   - Recommends or automates cost-saving actions (e.g., shutting down unused resources).

6. Change Impact Analysis Agent  
   - Predicts the impact of code or infra changes using historical data and dependency graphs.
   - Warns about risky changes before deployment.

7. ChatOps Agent  
   - Integrates with chat platforms to allow conversational control of pipelines, deployments, and monitoring.
   - Answers questions, triggers jobs, and summarizes status.
